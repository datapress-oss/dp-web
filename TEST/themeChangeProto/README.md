## This is a test project for prototyping the theme switching feature

### Usage:

1. Do the usual ` npm install `
2. You can spin up parcel's dev server with ` npm run dev `

<br>

#### Each theme should have its own *_somethingTheme.scss* file and then be imported into the bundle.scss entry point!

Once this component is finished it will be integrated into the main project.
